# Quantum-Field-Gravity-Neural-Network
See thesis.pdf for my final paper.

My work is part of Simon Caron-Huot's group at Mcgill University. One of the aims of the group is to develop a complete theoretical framework for a theory of quanutum field gravity. Another paper being prepared for submission to Journal of High Energy Physics. 

For people outside high energy physics, heres a quick links to understand the context of our work:
